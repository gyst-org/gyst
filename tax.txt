### Income Tax

For most students, their college experience is not complete without a part-time or summer job to help pay some of their tuition. For many this is their first time doing actual paid work. With this comes a responsibility to make sure they properly report their taxes to avoid having issues with the IRS.

#### When Getting a Job
Upon getting a formal position from a company, what needs to be is to filled out is a W-4. The W-4 is a form you fill out to determine how much money should be withheld from your paycheck and be paid to the federal government in taxes for things such as Social Security. This consists of filing out personal information that will effect how much is owed. This includes things such as home ownership and marriage status. If you need help calculating the exact amount the IRS provides a free online system to get a good idea.

Alternatively, some students, such as as those doing freelance programming or photography work will fill out a W-9. A W-9 is a form which whoever you are working for, uses to report to the IRS how much you will be paid. This is completed by you, and given to whoever is contracting you. The information needed for this only includes your name, social security number, and other simple stuff.


### When Tax Time Comes
At the end of the Tax year, which comes in March, you are then responsible for a couple of things:
#### W-2:
When working a formal position, one which requires a W-4, at the end of the fiscal year your employee will send you a copy of your W-2. You need to hang onto this, as it includes the total amount of money earned from the position, the amount of taxes withheld by the government, and how much into Social Security you paid into.

#### 1099-MISC:
Some jobs, internships, and freelancers will receive a 1099-MISC instead of a W-2. For the W-2, where your employer tells you how much you made and was deducted, with the 1099 you are told how much you made, and then you use it to report how much you owe the government. This is because with a 1099, you are considered a consultant or freelance employee.  With the 1099, you are then responsible to pay the government directly your income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare taxes

### Tax Returns	
After figuring out how much income, and other taxes you have paid you will fill out your tax return. Your tax return is done with a IRS 1040 form, which you submit together with some other information such as your W-2 and 1099. The point of the 1040 is to account for how much taxes you still owe and how much money you can earn back from tax deductions, and as a student there are a couple possible major deductions and forms that you should include to save yourself money.

#### 1098-T:
As a student in the Unites States you should be eligible for a tax deduction based off the cost of your education. This is done with the submission of a 1098-T form with your tax returns. This form should be sent out by your educational institution and will include how much money you have paid to the school and other information such as any amount of scholarships or grants used with your tuition.

#### 1098-E:
As a student you may have had to take out loans to pay for your education. The 1098-E is a form sent out by student loan lenders to each loan you have paid 600$ or more of interest on during the past year. Depending on the amount of the loans, and your income you may qualify for more tax deductions up to 2,500 dollars.
