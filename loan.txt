### What is the difference between FSA and loans? 
Federal Student Aid usually includes grants, loans and the work-study program. Loans is the money you owe to the Department of Education.

### How does federal student loan work?
Federal government only gives you eligibility for loans and educate you (poorly) about it. All  money is managed by private companies called loan servicers. Every disbursement(distribution) to you has a loan fee the company takes out that decreases over time, but you are responsible for the net loan amount.

### Are my loan servicer important?
Yes. You are supposed to tell them when you 	
    - Graduate
    - Change name, address, or phone number
    - Transfer
    - Drop below half-time enrollment/leave school
    - Want to change repayment plans
    - question/help

### What are the types of loans?
- Direct Subsidized: gove pays interest when you’re in school and deferment. Grace period is 6 month after you’re no longer in school.
- Direct Unsubsidized: interest adds up since day 1. Grace period is 6 month after you’re no longer in school.
- Direct PLUS Loans: Direct PLUS Loans enter repayment when they are fully disbursed (paid out), but loan will be placed into deferment while you are in school and the 6 month grace period after you’re no longer in school.
- Direct Consolidation Loans: you can consolidate all above loans for easier payment and more payment options, though late payments will screw you over even more.

### How much do I pay?
Usually a fixed amount of at least $50 each month for up to 10 years. Can be based on income after at least 20 years.

### When should I start paying?
ASAP. Paying early decreases your principle balance, i.e, interest. If you can’t pay even after the grace period, call your loan servicer. Bad stuff starts to happen IMMEDIATELY when you pay late.

### What’s the interest rate?
Usually 4.66% for undergraduate students.

### How can I pay less/late?
- change payment plan
- Deferment: you stop paying for a while with no interest for subsidized loans
- Forbearance: you stop paying for a while while interest adds up
- Forgiveness can happen if you work as teacher or in public service
- Discharge can happen only if something horrible happens
